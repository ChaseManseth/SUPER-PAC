# SUPER-PAC
This is a PAC-MAN game made in C++. Authors include Chase Manseth, Zachary Steudel, Meghan Bibb, Will Rhoden, and Bailey Stone. Our project is complete and we all did a fantastic job. Great job team!

# Notice
This was a project for the Baylor CSI 1430 class and we do not own the rights of this code as it was a university project and thus Baylor owns it. For any other people in CSI 1430 be aware that if you copy any of our code you are subject to punishment from your Professor if caught. Look at Baylor Honor code policy to see what may happen if you copy off this repository. The only useful thing you'll get from this repo is instructions of how to install SDL Plotter on your machine. It should be exactly the same with the lab computers. [Click this link for SDL Plotter install instrucitons](https://github.com/ChaseManseth/SUPER-PAC/blob/master/installSDL2.md).

Good Luck with your project!
